Heterogeneous data structures
     - Multiple data types
Homogeneous data structures
     - One data type
     - Interesting things about them
          - How to use
          - Organization
               - Performance 

Array -
     - Fixed size
     - Numerical Index
     - Fast random access
          - What makes it possible
               - All elements same type 
               - Fixed size
     - All elements are all next to each other

Day 2

Difficulty of arrays
     - Resizing
           - By creating a new copy of the array.
     - Deleting an index.
     - Insertion of an item.
          - Both of these are slow in start and middle

Linked List 
     - Every piece of data has a concept of a "next".
     - Node
          - Each has 2 properties.
               - Data
               - Next
          - List
               - Is made up of multiple nodes.
               - Location of nodes is not important.
               - What is required to transverse?
                    - Head
                         - The first node.
                    - Tail
                         - Purpose 
                              - To speed up operations. 
     - Has internal references to objects
     - Add a node to the front of a list
          - Steps
               - Create new object 
               - Link to new node.
               - Change this to HEAD.
     - Very important for steps to get done in the right order.
     - Very important to look at the boundary conditions
          - The special cases.
               - If the list is empty.
               - There are many items.
               - There is one item.
