Stefan's Freshman Year Notes!
========================

Notes for all my freshman year classes.

Included here will be my notes for every single one of my classes.

The classes are as follows:

CSCI.140.01 - Comp Science For AP Students

MATH.181.20 - Project-Based Calculus I

PHIL.102.14 - Introduction to Moral Issues

PSYC.101.10 - Introduction to Psychology

UWRT.150.39 - FYW: Writing Seminar

I will update them every day.

I am getting a scanner soon which will dramatically increase the quality of the notes.
